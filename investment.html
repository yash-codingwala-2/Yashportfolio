                                        There have been many situations where a man earning lakh per month lost everything because of profligacy.
                                        On the other hand, the man who made peanuts successfully earned himself by investing somewhere, which was
                                        a significant profit.</p>

                                        many people today tend to invest in other areas rather than saving in a risk-free environment. But being
                                        in your early 20s, you should start with the savings account to learn how money interacts, and this is how

                                        flix that indulging in the share market will start your downfall, and you will lose every single penny

                                        business model and working strategy, so if he rises, you rise, and if he falls, you fall too. Precisely
                                        this is how the stock market functions, and you need to analyze a particular company before investing. And

                                      <p>In earlier decades, think about the business, and there you need lakhs to invest. Not anymore, today you
                                        need few bucks and a creative mind to start your own business. Many young entrepreneurs began their
                                        journey with a minimal 10 to 20k in their hands and an innovative idea.</p>
                          
                          
                          
                                      <p>Their investment in their 20s starts to boom in their 30s, making them multimillionaires. But remember
                                        you need a great idea. Think about the CEO and founder of OYO, Ritesh Aggarwal. He started his business
                                        with just some 30k with a hotel, and boom, today he is the owner of the largest business chain existing in
                                        India.</p>

                                      <p>Don't worry! I am not suggesting you again about the share market or to do business yourself. If you
                                        don't have time or want your extra amount to be invested somewhere better, I suggest you become a partner
                                        with someone in their business. This is how you can expand your network and work efficiency without having
                                        all pressure alone on you.</p>

                                        because its success depends on how much time you give.</p>

                                      <p>This doesn't seem right ethically, but a great source where you can invest your money to work as an
                                        asset. When you lend money to people in need at higher rates, you earn a very good profit on it and if
                                        there are any sort of delay, you'll keep having your interest from them, which will be a great source to
                                        boost your investment in the 20s.</p>
                          
                          
                          
                                      <p>It's nothing but just a credit card model, as you lend few bucks from the credit card and need to pay
                                        with little interest and if there is any delay, then more and more interest. Just keep in mind you need to
                                        make money, not destroy someone, because ethics are more important than earning money.</p>

                                      <p>Look, I am a big fan of Robert Kiyosaki and his words. He once owned an apartment and later put that
                                        building on rent. This is a continuous source for you to have money, but yes, you won't recover your money
                                        with the rent only, but it will keep coming till you want. And when you want to sell it, and the market is
                                        relatively high, sell it with the proper profit.</p>
                          
                          
                          
                                      <p>The best part about real estate is, physical assets are more worthy than paper assets. Unlike Stocks,
                                        where you need to keep information about the national or global market, real estate requires only a local
                                        level of knowledge.</p>

                                      <p>A - The best way to buy the stock is to learn the market, study it, and analyze the chart pattern. Don't
